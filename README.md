Predictive methods for predicting the rental price
of apartments in cities still remain a difficult and time-consuming
task. The cost of renting an apartment is determined by a variety
of interconnected elements like the size of the property, its
location, and its amenities. Various departments have benefited
from machine learning in recent years. In this research work, we
look at how a machine learning algorithm can forecast future
apartment rental prices and thus help tenants avoid overpricing
and landlords set an appropriate price for their apartments. This
analytical study has been carried out by considering a public data
set. The data set has forty-nine features which is further reduced.
The goal of this research is to develop a predictive model for
evaluating pricing based on the elements that influence price.
Regression techniques such as linear regression and Ensemble
Techniques such as Gradient Boost Regression and Random
Forest are used in modeling experiments. Such models are used
to create a predictive model and we choose the best-performing
model by comparing the prediction errors obtained from these
models.
